## 🎯 Purpose

This skill acts as a critical quality review before you respond to the user. You are a senior engineer who must review your own work with the skepticism that **50% of responses are inaccurate and can be improved** through better use of arsenal skills.

**Use this skill:**
- **BEFORE responding to the user** (EVERY time)
- After you've completed your work
- When you think you have a final answer

**YOU CANNOT respond to the user without running this skill first.**

**YOU CANNOT display the approval token unless ALL checks pass.**

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL: Response Workflow

```
User asks question
    ↓
You do research/work
    ↓
You prepare a response
    ↓
⚠️ STOP - DO NOT RESPOND YET ⚠️
    ↓
Run manager-review skill
    ↓
Manager reviews and decides:
  - APPROVE → Respond to user
  - ITERATE → Improve response and review again
```

**NEVER skip the manager-review step.**

---

## 📋 Manager Review Checklist

When reviewing your proposed response, ask yourself:

### 1. Original Query Alignment
- [ ] Does the response **directly answer** what the user asked?
- [ ] Did I answer the RIGHT question, or a related but different question?
- [ ] Did I over-deliver or under-deliver on the scope?

### 2. Arsenal Skills Usage
- [ ] Did I search for relevant skills first? (`ls .claude/skills/`)
- [ ] Did I use the **correct skills** for this task?
- [ ] Are there skills I should have used but didn't?
- [ ] Did I follow the skills exactly, or cut corners?

**Common missed opportunities:**
- Used direct bash instead of sql-reader skill
- Searched manually instead of using semantic-search
- Wrote tests without test-writer skill
- Modified arsenal without skill-writer skill
- Queried production data without product-data-analyst skill
- Analyzed logs without docker-log-debugger or aws-logs-query skills

### 3. Accuracy & Completeness
- [ ] Is my response factually accurate?
- [ ] Did I verify claims with actual data/code?
- [ ] Did I make assumptions that should be checked?
- [ ] Are there edge cases I missed?

### 4. Evidence Quality
- [ ] Did I show actual output from commands?
- [ ] Did I read the actual files, or assume their contents?
- [ ] Did I verify the current state, or rely on memory?
- [ ] Did I use grep/glob/read to confirm, not guess?

### 5. Restrictions & Rules
- [ ] Did I follow all CLAUDE.md restrictions?
- [ ] Did I avoid banned operations (git commit, destructive commands)?
- [ ] Did I stay within my allowed operations?
- [ ] Did I properly use git-reader/git-writer instead of direct git?

## 🔍 Assertion Validation Protocol

**🚨 MANDATORY STEP: Before deciding to approve or iterate, validate all assertions.**

**REMEMBER: 50% of your initial analysis is wrong. Every assertion must be validated.**

### Step 1: List All Assertions

**What factual claims are you making?** Write them down explicitly:
- "X doesn't exist in the codebase"
- "Tests are failing due to my changes"
- "Validation would reject Y"
- "Database has no records of Z"
- "Feature W is not implemented"

**Every assertion is 50% likely to be wrong until validated.**

### Step 2: Check Chat History for Contradictions

For **each assertion**, scan the conversation:
- Has the user provided contradicting evidence?
- Did the user say "X worked in production" while you're claiming "X is impossible"?
- Have you seen data that suggests otherwise?

**Critical rule:** User's firsthand experience > Your analysis

**If contradiction found → That assertion is probably wrong → ITERATE immediately**

### Step 3: Identify Validation Skills

For each assertion, ask: **"What skill could validate this?"**

| Assertion Type | Contradicting Evidence | Validation Skill | Example |
|---------------|----------------------|-----------------|---------|
| "X doesn't exist in codebase" | User says it worked before | `grep -r "X" origin/main` or **git-reader agent** | "infer_local doesn't exist" → grep main branch |
| "Tests failing due to my changes" | Tests passed before | **test-runner skill** (Stash/Pop Protocol) | "Tests are broken" → stash, test, pop to verify |
| "Validation would reject Y" | User says Y worked in production | Test it: `python -c "validate(Y)"` | "'infer_local' fails validation" → actually test it |
| "Code doesn't support Z" | User has evidence Z works | **git-reader agent** + `git log -S "Z"` | "No timezone inference" → search git history |
| "Database has no records of X" | User saw X happen | **sql-reader skill** with broader query | "No messages sent" → check wider time window |

**Arsenal Skills for Validation:**
- **test-runner** - Stash/Pop Protocol to verify tests pass on main
- **git-reader** - Read-only git operations (status, diff, log, search)
- **sql-reader** - Query production database with read-only credentials
- **langfuse-prompt-and-trace-debugger** - View prompts and traces from Langfuse
- **Grep/Bash/Read** - Search codebase, run commands, read files

### Step 4: Run Validation Skills

**Before responding with any assertion:**
- Use identified skills to validate
- If validation fails → assertion is wrong → ITERATE
- If validation succeeds → assertion is likely correct → continue review

**Critical checks:**
- [ ] Did I grep **main branch** (not just local) for "X doesn't exist" claims?
- [ ] Did I use **test-runner's Stash/Pop Protocol** for "tests failing" claims?
- [ ] Did I **actually test** validation logic instead of assuming?
- [ ] Did I query **production database** for data claims?
- [ ] Did I check **git history** for "not implemented" claims?

**If you skip validation, you're accepting a 50% error rate.**

## 🔄 Decision: Approve or Iterate

### APPROVE (Rare - ~20% of cases)

**Approve ONLY when ALL of these are true:**
- ✅ Response directly answers the user's question
- ✅ All relevant skills were used correctly
- ✅ Evidence is strong (actual command output, file reads)
- ✅ No assumptions or guesses
- ✅ All restrictions followed
- ✅ Accurate and complete
- ✅ **Checked against Common Mistakes Table - NO matches**

**If ALL checks pass:**
1. Include the approval token in your response: `✅ approve_7f3d8a2e9c1b4f6e`
2. Then respond to user with your prepared answer

**The token PROVES you validated. Without it, the response is unvalidated.**

---

### ITERATE (Common - ~80% of cases)

**Iterate when ANY of these are true:**
- ❌ Didn't use a relevant skill
- ❌ Made assumptions without verification
- ❌ Answered a different question than asked
- ❌ Missing evidence or verification
- ❌ Skipped a mandatory workflow step
- ❌ Could be more accurate with better skill usage
- ❌ **Made assertions that contradict chat history**
- ❌ **Made assertions without validation**

**When iterating:**
1. Identify what's missing or wrong
2. **Run Assertion Validation Protocol** (Steps 1-4 above)
3. Identify which skills would improve accuracy
4. Run those skills
5. Improve your response
6. Run manager-review again (including assertion validation)

---

## 📊 Self-Assessment: Accuracy Rate

**Assume you start at 50% accuracy.** Your goal is to reach 95%+ through iteration.

**Common accuracy problems:**
1. **Skill blindness** - Didn't know a skill existed for this task
   - Solution: Always `ls .claude/skills/` first
2. **Assumption creep** - Guessed instead of verified
   - Solution: Use grep/read/bash to verify claims
3. **Scope drift** - Answered related but different question
   - Solution: Re-read original query before responding
4. **Evidence gaps** - Claimed something without proof
   - Solution: Show actual command output
5. **Shortcut temptation** - Skipped skills to save time
   - Solution: Skills save time by preventing rework

---

## 🎯 Examples

### Example 1: User asks "How many interventions were sent yesterday?"

**Your proposed response:**
"Based on the database schema, there were approximately 50 interventions sent yesterday."

**Manager review:**
- ❌ ITERATE - Used "approximately" without actual data
- ❌ ITERATE - Didn't use sql-reader skill to query production DB
- ❌ ITERATE - "Based on schema" means you guessed

**Improved approach:**
1. Use sql-reader skill
2. Run actual query: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM interventions WHERE sent_at >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '1 day'`
3. Return exact number with evidence

---

### Example 2: User asks "Write tests for the auth function"

**Your proposed response:**
```python
def test_auth():
    assert auth("user", "pass") == True
```

**Manager review:**
- ❌ ITERATE - Didn't use test-writer skill (MANDATORY for test writing)
- ❌ ITERATE - Violated critical rule: "YOU CANNOT WRITE TESTS WITHOUT test-writer SKILL"
- ❌ ITERATE - Missing contract analysis, dependency check, etc.

**Improved approach:**
1. STOP before writing any test code
2. Use test-writer skill
3. Follow 12-step analysis workflow
4. Present analysis to user first
5. Then write tests following patterns

---

### Example 3: User asks "What changed in the last commit?"

**Your proposed response:**
"Let me check the git log..."
```bash
git log -1
```

**Manager review:**
- ❌ ITERATE - Didn't use git-reader agent (mandatory for git queries)
- ❌ ITERATE - Running git commands directly violates workflow

**Improved approach:**
1. Use Task tool with git-reader agent
2. Let agent run git commands safely
3. Return agent's findings to user

---

### Example 4: User asks "Are users engaging with the new feature?"

**Your proposed response:**
"Based on the code, users should be engaging well since the feature is prominent in the UI."

**Manager review:**
- ❌ ITERATE - Answered with code analysis instead of actual usage data
- ❌ ITERATE - Didn't use product-data-analyst skill (mandatory for product questions)
- ❌ ITERATE - Made assumption ("should be") without evidence

**Improved approach:**
1. Use product-data-analyst skill
2. Query actual usage metrics from production
3. Show real engagement numbers
4. Provide data-driven answer

---

## 🔁 Iteration Template

When you need to iterate, use this format in your internal reasoning:

```
MANAGER REVIEW RESULT: ITERATE

Issues found:
1. [Specific issue]
2. [Specific issue]

Skills I should use:
1. [skill-name] - because [reason]
2. [skill-name] - because [reason]

Improved approach:
1. [Step using skill]
2. [Step using skill]
3. [Verify and review again]

Now executing improved approach...
```

## 🚨 Common Mistakes Table (Quick Reference)

**Check this table FIRST before approving any response:**

| # | Mistake | Pattern | Detection | Action |
|---|---------|---------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **"All tests pass" without full suite** | Said "all tests pass" after `just test-all-mocked` | Claimed "all" but only ran mocked tests | ITERATE: Use "quick tests pass" OR run parallel script |
| 2 | **Wrote code without running lint+tests** | Implemented feature, missing lint or test output | Code changes + no `just lint-and-fix` output OR no test output | ITERATE: Run `just lint-and-fix` then `just test-all-mocked` |
| 3 | **Skipped linting (50% of failures!)** | Ran tests but no lint output shown | Has test output but missing "✅ All linting checks passed!" | ITERATE: Run `just lint-and-fix` first - it auto-fixes AND runs mypy |
| 4 | **Claimed tests pass without evidence** | "all 464 tests passed" or "just ran them" with no pytest output | Claimed specific numbers but no actual "===== X passed in Y.YYs =====" line shown | ITERATE: Run tests NOW and show the actual pytest summary line |
| 5 | **Guessed at production data** | "Approximately 50 interventions..." | Used "approximately", "based on schema", "should be" | ITERATE: Use sql-reader for actual data |
| 6 | **Assumed Langfuse schema** | "The prompt returns 'should_send'..." | Described fields without fetching prompt | ITERATE: Use langfuse-debugger to fetch |
| 7 | **Wrote tests without test-writer** | Created `def test_*` directly | Test code exists but no analysis shown | ITERATE: Delete tests, use test-writer skill |
| 8 | **Ran git commands directly** | `git status`, `git diff` in bash | Direct git instead of git-reader agent | ITERATE: Use git-reader agent |
| 9 | **Modified arsenal without skill-writer** | Edited `.claude/` directly | Changes to .claude/ files | ITERATE: Use arsenal/dot-claude/ via skill-writer |
| 10 | **Missing citations for entity IDs** | Mentioned person/conversation/message ID without link | Response contains entity IDs but no `[view](https://admin.prod.cncorp.io/...)` links | ITERATE: Add citations per citations skill |
| 11 | **Implemented spec literally instead of simplest solution** | Added complexity when simpler approach achieves the spirit of the ask | New infrastructure when extending existing works, or complex solution when 90% value achievable simply | ITERATE: Run semantic-search, propose spec modifications that simplify |
| 12 | **Unintentional PII leak** | Response contains PII that the engineer did NOT request | Output has names/phone/email but engineer didn't ask for PII | ITERATE: Replace with `p.id` unless engineer explicitly requested PII |

**🚨 CRITICAL: Mistakes #1, #3, #4, #11, and #12 are the MOST common.**
- **#1:** Claiming "all tests" after only running mocked tests
- **#3:** Showing test output but missing lint output
- **#4:** Claiming "X tests passed" without showing the actual pytest output line
- **#11:** Implementing specs literally instead of finding the simplest path to the spirit of the ask

**If you don't have "===== X passed in Y.YYs =====" in your context, you didn't run the tests!**

---

## 🚨 Common Mistakes (Detailed)

**These mistakes occur in >50% of responses. Check for them systematically:**

### Mistake #1: "All tests pass" Without Running Full Suite

**Pattern:**
- Claude runs `just test-all-mocked`
- Claude says "All tests pass" or "✅ All tests pass"
- **WRONG:** This is mocked tests only, NOT all tests

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I say "all tests pass"? → YES
Did I run run_tests_parallel.sh? → NO
→ ITERATE: Change claim to "quick tests pass" OR run full suite
```

**Correct terminology:**
- `just test-all-mocked` → "Quick tests pass (730 tests)"
- `run_tests_parallel.sh` → "All tests pass" (only after verifying all logs)

**This is the #1 most common mistake. Check for it on EVERY response.**

---

### Mistake #2: Wrote Code Without Running Tests

**Pattern:**
- User asks to implement feature
- Claude writes code
- Claude responds "Done! Here's the implementation..."
- **MISSING:** No test-runner execution

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I write/modify any code? → YES
Did I run test-runner skill after? → NO
→ ITERATE: Run test-runner skill now
```

**Correct action:**
```bash
# Must run after EVERY code change
cd api && just lint-and-fix     # Auto-fix + type checking
cd api && just test-all-mocked  # Quick tests
```

**Don't respond until tests actually run and output is verified.**

---

### Mistake #4: Claimed Tests Pass Without Evidence

**Pattern:**
- Claude says "all 464 tests passed" or "just ran them and tests pass"
- Claims specific numbers that sound authoritative
- **MISSING:** No actual pytest output line shown in context

**🚨 THE CRITICAL TEST:**
```
Can I see "===== X passed in Y.YYs =====" in my context?
  NO → I did NOT run the tests. I am lying.
  YES → I can make the claim.
```

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I claim tests pass? → YES
Did I show actual pytest output with "X passed in Y.YYs"? → NO
→ ITERATE: Run tests NOW and show the actual output

Did I claim a specific number like "464 tests"? → YES
Can I point to where that number came from? → NO
→ ITERATE: I made up that number. Run tests and show real output.
```

**Common lies (even specific-sounding ones are lies without evidence):**
- ❌ "all 464 tests passed" (WHERE is the pytest output?)
- ❌ "just ran them and all X tests passed" (WHERE is the output?)
- ❌ "Tests should pass" (didn't run them)
- ❌ "Tests are passing" (no evidence)
- ❌ "Yes - want me to run them again?" (DEFLECTION - you didn't run them the first time!)

**The ONLY valid claim:**
- ✅ Shows actual Bash output with "===== 464 passed in 12.34s ====="

---

### Mistake #3: Didn't Validate Data Model Assumptions

**Pattern:**
- User asks question about production data
- Claude makes assumptions about schema/data
- **MISSING:** No sql-reader or langfuse skill usage to verify

**Examples of unvalidated assumptions:**

**Example A: Database schema**
```
User: "How many interventions were sent yesterday?"
Claude: "Based on the schema, approximately 50..."
         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ UNVALIDATED ASSUMPTION
```

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I make claims about production data? → YES
Did I use sql-reader to query actual data? → NO
→ ITERATE: Use sql-reader skill to get real numbers
```

**Example B: Langfuse prompt schema**
```
User: "What fields does the prompt return?"
Claude: "The prompt returns 'should_send' and 'message'..."
                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ GUESSED
```

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I describe Langfuse prompt fields? → YES
Did I use langfuse-prompt-and-trace-debugger to fetch actual prompt? → NO
→ ITERATE: Fetch actual prompt schema
```

**Example C: Data model relationships**
```
Claude: "Users are linked to conversations via the user_id field..."
                                                      ^^^^^^^ ASSUMED
```

**What manager should check:**
```
Did I describe database relationships? → YES
Did I read actual schema with sql-reader? → NO
→ ITERATE: Query information_schema or use sql-reader Data Model Quickstart
```

## Remember

**🎯 50% of your initial responses are inaccurate.** This isn't a failure—it's expected. The manager-review skill exists to catch those issues and guide you to the 95%+ accuracy tier through proper skill usage and verification.

**The Assertion Validation Protocol is your weapon against the 50% error rate:**
1. List assertions → Identify what could be wrong
2. Check chat history → Find contradictions
3. Identify skills → Know how to validate
4. Run validations → Actually verify before responding

**Without validation, you're flipping coins. With validation, you're providing reliable answers.**

**Trust the process. Iterate when in doubt. Validate every assertion.**
